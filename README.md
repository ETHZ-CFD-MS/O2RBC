O2RBC
=====

The library O2RBC is an OpenFOAM extension for oxygen transport from red blood cells.
It also features a Python library for pre- and postprocessing of simulations,
including data visualization.

Getting started
---------------

### Prerequisites

O2RBC has been tested on various Linux distributions (CentOS, Ubuntu) as well as
macOS.

### Installation

Detailed installation instructions are available in the file
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

### Running the code

The easiest way to get started is to run the [tutorials](tutorials/README.md). 
Each case is equipped with a shell script `Allrun` that setups and runs simulations.

Getting help
------------

The oxygen transport code is documented using Doxygen. The building instructions
for this documentation are given in the file [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
