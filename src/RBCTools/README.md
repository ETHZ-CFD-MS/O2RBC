The RBCTools library                   {#RBCToolspage}
--------------------

The RBCTools library contains classes related to red blood cells (RBCs) and
operations.

The fundamental entity is the class [RBC](@ref Foam::RBC). The class
[RBCCollection](@ref Foam::RBCCollection) implements a collection of RBC with
various adding/removing functionalities and setters for fields on RBCs.
The RBC mesh is held by this class. The motion of RBCs is performed by concrete
implementations of [RBCMover](@ref Foam::RBCMover). RBC motion based on RBC
paths generated by a third-party program employs the classes 
[RBCPath](@ref Foam::RBCPath) and [RBCPathCollection](@ref Foam::RBCPathCollection).
The class [RBCInterpolation](@ref Foam::RBCInterpolation) provides an interface
for interpolation between moving RBCs and another mesh.

For simulations of oxygen transport in an axisymmetric domain, the class
[analyticalSolutionPO2Cone](@ref Foam::analyticalSolutionPO2Cone) implements the
analytical solution to the oxygen transport equations. This is useful for
obtaining a good initial condition. The diffusion and solubility coefficients
may take different values in RBCs, the plasma, the capillary endothelium and the
tissue. The class [regionDependentField](@ref regionDependentField) provides
easy handling of such fields.
