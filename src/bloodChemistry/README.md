The bloodChemistry library                   {#bloodChemistrypage}
--------------------------

This library is used to describe the chemistry of species found in
blood. It contains the abstract base class 
[dissociationCurve](@ref Foam::dissociationCurve) for the oxygen-hemoglobin 
dissociation curve and the a concrete implementation with the Hill equation,
[dissociationCurve](@ref Foam::dissociationCurveHill).
